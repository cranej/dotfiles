Modified based on Amir Salihefendic's version. See the comments at beginning of the file if you want a advanced version.

I added MarkdownPreview function and bind to `<leader>mc`, to use this feature you need `pandoc` installed and available on your path .

Backup your `.vimrc` file and `cd ~ && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cranej/dotfiles/master/vimrc > .vimrc`
